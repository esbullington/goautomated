As I read comments from small/medium-sized business online communities on Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and peruse freelance job offers on Upwork, I'm struck by how often entrepreneurs are paying people hundreds or thousands of dollars to do the same basic business automation tasks over and over again. In many cases, these kinds of monotonous Internet-based tasks are solved problems for businesses run by software developers, or more technically-inclined owners.

In particular, I'm surprised by how many people are still paying big dollars for "integrations" of Internet-based services (Software-as-a-Service or Saas) -- sometimes with other online services, and sometimes with traditional desktop software -- when we have reasonably-priced IaaS (Integration-as-a-Service) platforms like [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and [Segment](https://segment.com).  Combined with one or more SaaS services, even the consumer-focused [Ifft](https://iftt.com) is capable of solving many of the automation challenges that small businesses face.

My goal with this blog will be to help the owners and employees of small- and medium-sized businesses to learn and apply the online services offered by the various SaaS providers, and when possible, to integrate those services themselves using Zapier and other online services.
