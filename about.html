<p> As a rich man once said, “software is eating the world”.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;Jobs, income, and success are increasingly divided between those who understand programming and analytics, and those who don’t. The reason for this is clear: software – and more generally automation – provide a huge return on investments of time and money. The ability to easily automate onerous tasks, tabulate data, and increase general productivity is a very, very valuable skill.</p>

<p>But as a small business owner interested in automation and productivity, no one needs to convince *you* of this.  Instead, I'll make a brief pitch for using new web-based integration services like Zapier and IFTTT and how they have the potential to make your business life dramatically easier.  I have no affiliation with these services  –  I'm just a fan and the possibilities the offer business owners, which were formally only available to competent software developers.</p>

<p>Now, with a small degree of technical competence and motivation, business owners can automate all many, perhaps even all, of the repetitive, onerous tasks they perform on the computer, all without spending thousands of dollars paying for programmers.</p>

<p>To kick things off, I'll select a series of automation/productivity jobs advertised to software developers on job boards like Elance and UpWork (formerly ODesk), complete the jobs *without using any code* by means of services like Zapier, and write up detailed descriptions of my feats on this blog.</p>

<p>In addition, I welcome submissions from readers describing some task that could save them hours of weekly work or thousands of dollars.  Each week, I'll select one such submission, create an automated solution using Zapier or a similar service, and write up a detailed account of what I've done.</p>

<p>So follow along as I work to bring the productivity gains programmers have enjoyed for decades to the general small business community, and learn how to make your life easier through the use of modern web-based software services.</p>
